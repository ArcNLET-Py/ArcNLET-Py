## 3.1 Organization of the Manual

The structure of the manual is as follows: the manual begins with an abbreviated description of the simplified model used in this software, followed by a discussion of the assumptions employed in the model (Chapter 2). After a brief overview of the simplified model, the focus turns to the installation of the software and a general overview on its functioning; a reference to each module is also given (Chapter 3). Finally, in Chapter 4, an example problem is provided for preparing the input files and executing the software.

The measurement units used in this manual may vary between metric and imperial units. However required units will always be explicitly stated.

In order to make this manual easier to read, a certain typographic convention has been adopted:
• Model inputs and parameters always appear in bold font.
• Names of attributes in a shapefile’s attribute table are always shown in a typewriter font.
